/*You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of 
CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to 
modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. 
A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it 
something like _partial.scss. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is
 only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. 
 Sass partials are used with the @use rule.*/
